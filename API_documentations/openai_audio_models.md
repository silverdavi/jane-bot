# OpenAI Next-Generation Audio Models Documentation

## Overview

In March 2025, OpenAI introduced a suite of next-generation audio models that significantly advance transcription and voice generation capabilities. These models are designed to support OpenAI's broader "agentic" vision of building automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users.

## New Audio Models Release

### Speech-to-Text Models

#### `gpt-4o-transcribe` and `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`

These models effectively replace OpenAI's long-standing Whisper transcription model, offering significant improvements in accuracy and performance.

**Key Improvements:**
- **Enhanced Word Error Rate (WER)**: Outperform Whisper v2 and v3 across various benchmarks
- **Better Accent Recognition**: Improved handling of diverse accents and speech variations
- **Noise Resilience**: Superior performance in chaotic environments with background noise
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Significantly less likely to fabricate words or passages compared to Whisper
- **Speed Variation Handling**: Better adaptation to different speech speeds

**Technical Features:**
- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Stream audio in and receive text stream back in real-time
- **Built-in Noise Cancellation**: Integrated noise reduction capabilities
- **Semantic Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Transcribes only when users have finished their thoughts
- **Training Dataset**: Trained on diverse, high-quality audio datasets

**Language Performance Limitations:**
- **Word Error Rate for Indic/Dravidian Languages**: Approaches 30% for languages like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada
- **Best Performance**: Optimized for English and major European languages

### Text-to-Speech Model

#### `gpt-4o-mini-tts`

A revolutionary text-to-speech model that introduces unprecedented control over voice characteristics and delivery.

**Key Features:**
- **Steerability**: Developers can instruct the model on how to say things using natural language
- **Emotional Range**: Support for wide spectrum of emotions and delivery styles
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Voice can adapt to specific scenarios and use cases
- **10 Preset Voices**: Starting with 10 base voices that can be customized

**Voice Control Examples:**
- "Speak like a mad scientist"

## API Integration

### Basic Implementation

#### Speech-to-Text Usage
```python
import openai

# Using the new transcription models
response = openai.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-transcribe",  # or "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"
    file=audio_file,
    response_format="json"
)
```

#### Text-to-Speech Usage
```python
# Using the new TTS model with steerability
response = openai.audio.speech.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-tts",
    voice="professional",
    input="Your text here",
    instructions="Speak like a sympathetic customer service agent"
)
```

### Agents SDK Integration

The updated Agents SDK allows developers to add audio capabilities to text agents with minimal code changes:

```python
# Convert text agent to audio agent
from openai import agents

# Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
agent = agents.create_audio_agent(
    base_agent=your_text_agent,
    speech_to_text_model="gpt-4o-mini-transcribe",
    text_to_speech_model="gpt-4o-mini-tts"
)
```
