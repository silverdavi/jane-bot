- "hey jane"
- "hello jane" 
- "jane"
- "computer"

Stop Commands (to end demo):
- "stop demo"
- "end demo"
- "quit demo"

Note: Wake words activate conversation mode. Stop commands work during any state - continuous listening, wake detection, or question recording.

AUDIO SETTINGS AND TIMING
==========================

Sample Rate: 16kHz
Audio Quality: High fidelity for accurate transcription

Wake Word Detection:
- Chunk Duration: 3 seconds per audio segment

- Chunk Size: 200ms segments for real-time processing
- Silence Threshold: 0.005 (sensitive detection)
- Silence Duration to Stop: 2 seconds of quiet
- Maximum Silence Wait: 10 seconds (prevents infinite waiting)
- Minimum Recording Time: 1 second before checking silence

   - Full question-answer interaction
   - Returns to wake word detection after response

3. Question Recording Mode:
   - Advanced voice activity detection
   - Real-time visual feedback showing speaking/silence
   - Automatic stop on natural pause
   - Smart fallback if no clear voice detected

BACKGROUND Thread (Ambient Monitoring):
4. Continuous Transcription Mode:
   - Always running in background
   - Silent ambient audio transcription
   - Persistent buffer management
   - Sliding window summarization every 45 seconds
   - Background stop command detection

KNOWLEDGE BASE SYSTEM
=====================

File Types Created:

1. Conversation Files (conversation_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt):
   - Direct Q&A interactions with Jane
   - Contains question, answer, and timestamp
   - Created after each successful conversation

2. Sliding Window Summary Files (ambient_sliding_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt):
   - Contextual summaries using overlapping windows
   - Generated every 45 seconds with 15-segment windows
   - Includes context from previous segments for continuity
   - Contains window metadata, duration, and processing details
   - Only saved if meaningful new content detected

3. Transcription Buffer (transcription_buffer.json):
   - Persistent storage of all transcription segments
   - Maintains processing state and indexes
   - Enables conversation continuity across sessions
   - Automatic cleanup while preserving context

4. Help Documentation (this file):
   - System reference and capabilities
   - Wake words, commands, and settings
   - Operational procedures and timing

Storage Location: kb/user/ directory
All files include timestamps and metadata

QUESTION ANALYSIS PROCESS
=========================

Jane uses a 2-step intelligent response process:

Step 1 - Gemini Analysis:
- Determines if question can be answered directly
- Checks if knowledge base search needed
- Identifies appropriate emotional tone
- Provides raw response or search strategy

Step 2 - GPT-4o-Mini Polishing:
- Makes responses natural and conversational
- Optimizes for voice interaction
- Maintains emotional tone
- Ensures clarity and conciseness

TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION
===========================

Common Issues and Solutions:

Poor Wake Word Detection:
- Speak louder and clearer
- Get closer to microphone (1-2 feet optimal)
- Reduce background noise
- Check microphone permissions

Poor Question Transcription:
- Speak at normal conversational pace
- Wait for voice activity indicator to show ðŸ”Š SPEAKING
- Allow natural pauses to trigger recording stop
- Ensure microphone sensitivity is adequate

Audio Playback Issues:
- Check speaker/headphone connections
- Verify system audio settings
- Ensure afplay (macOS) is available

API Connection Problems:
- Verify API keys in config/api_keys.env
- Check internet connection
- Ensure sufficient API credits

Stop Command Not Working:
- Speak "stop demo" clearly during any transcription
- Command works in all states, not just conversation
- Alternative phrases: "end demo", "quit demo"
